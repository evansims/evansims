### Howdy! Evan here. 👋

Founder and engineer at [Principle Alchemy](https://pralch.com) — a new development agency focused on creating impactful services that make a meaningful difference in the everyday lives of real people.

Previously: Senior Engineer at [Okta](https://okta.com), where I led developer experience, authentication and authorization initiatives across [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev). Before that, I helped build developer tools and crisis-response systems at [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com), an experience that shaped my focus on security, privacy, and human-centered engineering.

Passionate about open source, digital wellbeing, and designing systems that last. Former game designer turned builder of better worlds — one product at a time.

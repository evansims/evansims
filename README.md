### Howdy! Evan here. 👋

Founder at [Principle Alchemy](https://pralch.com). Currently building our first product, [InferaDB](https://inferadb.com), a next-generation fine-grained authorization system inspired by Google Zanzibar and based on the emerging AuthZEN standard. InferaDB provides a strongly consistent, inference-driven policy engine designed for high scale, low latency, and developer-first integration. Our goal is to make authorization explainable, composable, and programmable - enabling developers to model complex relationships, define policies declaratively or via WASM modules, and deploy secure, auditable access control across distributed systems, APIs, and AI platforms.

Previously: Senior Engineer at [Okta](https://okta.com), where I led developer experience, authentication and authorization initiatives across [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev). Before that, I helped build developer tools and crisis-response systems at [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com), an experience that shaped my focus on security, privacy, and human-centered engineering.

Passionate about open source, digital wellbeing, and designing systems that last. Former game designer turned builder of better worlds — one product at a time.

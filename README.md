### Howdy! Evan here. 👋

**Senior Engineer at [Okta](https://okta.com)** working on [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev) and [Auth0 FGA](https://auth0.com/fine-grained-authorization). Previously built Auth0's SDKs and crisis-response tools at [Ushahidi](https://ushahidi.com), where protecting user data in life-threatening situations shaped my focus on security engineering.

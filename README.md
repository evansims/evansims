### Howdy! Evan here. üëã

**I'm a Senior Engineer at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) in the Urbana-Champaign, Illinois area.** I work on [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev) and [Auth0 FGA](https://auth0.com/fine-grained-authorization), and I previously worked on Auth0's extensive collection of open source SDK libraries. I'm passionate about open-source software development and communities and about helping developers build more secure software.

Previously, I was a Senior Engineer on the immensely consequential open source [Ushahidi](https://ushahidi.com) platform, a powerful tool for (among many other uses) crowdsourcing data in life-threatening emergencies, protecting civil liberties, defending democratic voting processes, and empowering citizen journalism. I'm still incredibly proud of the work done there. My work at Ushahidi is what solidified the importance of security engineering in my mind; the protection of personal data you're entrusted with is an incredible responsibility that can truly mean the difference between life and death for people in some dangerous situations. These learnings are what have driven my career toward the security and privacy space ever since, and what I continue to make an absolute priority in all my work.

In what now feels like a previous life, I was a Video Game Designer and worked on several commercial titles for Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation. I still adore building video games, but now I just dabble in them for fun.

# Tinybird Configuration

Note: Currently Traffic Analytics features are behind a feature flag. For now, you'll need to enable it by following the steps below:

1. Create a Tinybird account and a Tinybird workspace at [tinybird.co](https://auth.tinybird.co/login). You can select any cloud/region you choose.
1. Run `docker compose run --rm tinybird-login` to login to your Tinybird account following the steps given
1. Run `docker compose run --rm tinybird-sync`. This will copy the Tinybird files from the Ghost container into a shared volume. The service should log "Tinybird files synced into shared volume.", then exit.
1. Run `docker compose run --rm tinybird-deploy` and wait for the service to exit successfully. This will create your Tinybird datasources, pipes and API endpoints. It may take a minute or two to complete the first time. You should see "Deployment #1 is live!" in your terminal before the service exits.
1. Run `docker compose run --rm tinybird-login get-tokens`
1. Copy and paste the values from the previous step into your `.env` file
1. Run `docker compose --profile=analytics up -d` to start all services in the background
1. Add `analytics` to `COMPOSE_PROFILES=` in the top of your `.env` file to automatically include the `analytics` profile when running `docker compose` commands
1. At this point, everything should be working. You can test it's working by visiting your site's homepage, then checking the Stats page in Ghost Admin — you should see a view recorded.
